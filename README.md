# Asterisk Launcher

This basically a little dumb project of mine where i made an intepreter for the joke esolang *.

## Usage

So there are two modes. Interpreter and file mode.

THe interpreter mode launches when no arguments are given. It runs as a shell and it does the commands you give it. easy.
The file mode, on the other hand, runs when an argument is given. The argument is expected to be a .ast file. That means you can run Asterisk Launcher this way:
<code>py Asterisk_Launcher.py example.ast</code>
